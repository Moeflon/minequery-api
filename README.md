minequery-api
=============

Minequery.net is a Minecraft serverlist that also has a handy API which makes it easier for server owners to create a professional looking and functional website.

You can use the example.php file to test out and learn about the features (it's not that hard).
If you have any problems configuring the API, please contact us at support@minequery.net and we'll help you as soon as possible.

## To Do
